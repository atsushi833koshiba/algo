## About My Data Structure
I used data structure of linkedlist to build block chain surely.

## Time and Space
It is O(1) abount order when I add a block.
But, when the block chain which has many blocks is traversed,
it will take a lot of time.

As to space, there is not wasted or duplicated data.
So, it is OK!
