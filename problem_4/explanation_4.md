## About My Data Structure
I used binary search to find a given user in some groups.

## Time and Space
It is O(logn).
Because I used binary search.
Exactly, when my code searches for user.
It uses some loop,
but worst order is O(logn) because of above.

As to space, there is not wasted or duplicated data.
So, it is OK!

## why did I sort user list?
I used binary search to to find user in groups.
To use this way, the list must be sored before searching for user to order by user name.
So, I used sort.
