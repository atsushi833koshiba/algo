## About My Data Structure
I used binary search to find a given user in some groups.

## Time and Space
It may be O(logn).
I did't know an order when sort appear in the loop.
I used sort function in a loop when my code traverses group.
In this loop, I used sort and my binary search.

As to space, there is not wasted or duplicated data.
So, it is OK!
